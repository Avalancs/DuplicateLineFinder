# Duplicate Line Finder by case
This program is to print out duplicate lines from a file,
where the difference between the duplicate lines are
lower- and uppercase letters.

This is useful if you have a list of file names on linux that you want to
put in a zip file, but worry that you will not be able to unzip on windows.
